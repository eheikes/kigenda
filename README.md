# Kigenda

These are the files for the Kigenda project pitched at Startup Weekend Des Moines 2012.

It's just a mockup, so most of the functionality is just simulated.

## Server Requirements

To run the mockup, you'll need a server running PHP5 with the SimpleXML extension. If you don't have that, you can just load the static `demo.html` file.

## Client Requirements

The mockup was tested on the Chrome browser. It may not look perfect in IE and other browsers.
